## My project - the site I’ve created URBAN UMBRELLA means to be a helping hand for newcomers to London.
I wanted to share a personal journey that led me to create a web resource dedicated to those, like myself, who embarked on a new chapter in London.
Having moved from the east of Ukraine, just 30 km from the war line, I found myself facing numerous challenges upon arriving in this vibrant yet unfamiliar city. Reflecting on my experiences, I was motivated to build a project that could serve as a guiding light for newcomers, something I wish I had when I first arrived.

This project is more than a website; it’s a heartfelt effort to solve the practical problems encountered by those who, like me, have taken the brave step of starting anew. From navigating the health system to understanding the complexity of banking, transportation, education, and more, the aim is to provide an accumulated guide based on real experiences.

Through this project , I’ve learned the immense power of shared knowledge in making a positive impact on the lives of others. It goes beyond just information; it’s about building a community that supports and uplifts those who are starting their journey in a new land.

What makes this project stand out is its heartfelt approach to addressing the varied challenges of relocation. It’s not just about facts and figures; it’s about the human experience and the emotions tied to building a new life.

I invite you to explore this resource, knowing that it was crafted with empathy, understanding, and the genuine desire to make the transition to London a bit smoother for those who, like us, have ventured into the unknown.

Wishing you all the best on your journey!


## My motivation

 ## Future of the project.
  This project is not finished yet, it is under construction.
 I plan to continue developing the website, adding more necessary information, finish all pages, contact with future users, add  languages, feedback. In the future I plan to launch a project on the Internet and continue to help newcomers.
