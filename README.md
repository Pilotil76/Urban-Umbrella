My project - the site I’ve created URBAN UMBRELLA means to be a helping hand for newcomers to London.
When I arrived in London, everything felt new and a bit confusing. That’s why I made this special website—to be like a friendly guide for newcomers, just like I wished I had.

Moving to a new place can make anyone feel a bit lost. It’s like being in a big, unfamiliar puzzle. I know that feeling because I’ve been there. And you know what? Lots of people feel the same way when they come here.

What makes my website different? Well, it’s like a cozy blanket of information. I noticed there wasn’t one place with all the important things newcomers might want to know—like about health, money, buses, schools, homes, and jobs. So, I decided to create that place.

Imagine having a friend who understands how it feels to start fresh. That’s what this website is. It’s not just facts; it’s like a friendly chat, saying, “Hey, you’re not alone, and I’m here to help.”

So, if you or someone you know is new to London, check it out. It’s not just a website; it’s a piece of my heart reaching out to yours, saying, “You’re not alone, and we can figure this out together.”

Wishing you the very best on your new adventure in the best city in the world .
## My motivation
was to create a helpful resource for newcomers to London, drawing from my own experiences as a refugee from Ukraine.

The project aims to solve the challenges faced by newcomers by providing essential information on various aspects of life in London.

Through this project , I have  learned the value of sharing practical knowledge to assist others in navigating a new environment.

My project stands out for its complete  coverage, addressing key areas like health, banking, education, housing, and more, offering a useful guide for those starting a new chapter in London.
