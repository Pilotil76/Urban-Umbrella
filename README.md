## My project - the site I’ve created URBAN UMBRELLA means to be a helping hand for newcomers to London.
I wanted to share a personal journey that led me to create a web resource dedicated to those, like myself, who embarked on a new chapter in London.
Having moved from the east of Ukraine, just 30 km from the war line, I found myself facing numerous challenges upon arriving in this vibrant yet unfamiliar city. Reflecting on my experiences, I was motivated to build a project that could serve as a guiding light for newcomers, something I wish I had when I first arrived.

This project is more than a website; it’s a heartfelt effort to solve the practical problems encountered by those who, like me, have taken the brave step of starting anew. From navigating the health system to understanding the complexity of banking, transportation, education, and more, the aim is to provide an accumulated guide based on real experiences.

Through this project , I’ve learned the immense power of shared knowledge in making a positive impact on the lives of others. It goes beyond just information; it’s about building a community that supports and uplifts those who are starting their journey in a new land.

What makes this project stand out is its heartfelt approach to addressing the varied challenges of relocation. It’s not just about facts and figures; it’s about the human experience and the emotions tied to building a new life.

I invite you to explore this resource, knowing that it was crafted with empathy, understanding, and the genuine desire to make the transition to London a bit smoother for those who, like us, have ventured into the unknown.

Wishing you all the best on your journey!


## My motivation
was to create a helpful resource for newcomers to London, drawing from my own experiences as a refugee from Ukraine.

The project aims to solve the challenges faced by newcomers by providing essential information on various aspects of life in London.

Through this project , I have  learned the value of sharing practical knowledge to assist others in navigating a new environment.

My project stands out for its complete  coverage, addressing key areas like health, banking, education, housing, and more, offering a useful guide for those starting a new chapter in London.

## Project 2 JavaScript
 
For this part of the project, I've added a script.js file for some functions:
1. Simple database including name, last name, email, and password.
2. From the Contact HTML page program verify an email address and if the email is in the database will open the signin.html page.
3. From the signin.html page program verifies the email address and password, if all correct users will be transferred into the message.html page for future contacts from the administrator.
4. If the password or email is invalid on the screen will be an alarm note and after 3 unsuccessful attempts user will be redirected to the contact-us.html page.
 5. If the Contact HTML page can’t verify the email address will redirect to the signup.html page to register a new user. 
6. After registration and pressing the “Register” button user will be redirected to the signin.html page.




 ## Future of the project.
  This project is not finished yet, it is under construction.
 I plan to continue developing the website, adding more necessary information, finish all pages, contact with future users, add  languages, feedback. In the future I plan to launch a project on the Internet and continue to help newcomers.
