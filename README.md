# My project - the site I’ve created URBAN UMBRELLA means to be a helping hand for newcomers to London.
When I arrived in London, everything felt new and a bit confusing. That’s why I made this special website—to be like a friendly guide for newcomers, just like I wished I had.

Moving to a new place can make anyone feel a bit lost. It’s like being in a big, unfamiliar puzzle. I know that feeling because I’ve been there. And you know what? Lots of people feel the same way when they come here.

What makes my website different? Well, it’s like a cozy blanket of information. I noticed there wasn’t one place with all the important things newcomers might want to know—like about health, money, buses, schools, homes, and jobs. So, I decided to create that place.

Imagine having a friend who understands how it feels to start fresh. That’s what this website is. It’s not just facts; it’s like a friendly chat, saying, “Hey, you’re not alone, and I’m here to help.”

So, if you or someone you know is new to London, check it out. It’s not just a website; it’s a piece of my heart reaching out to yours, saying, “You’re not alone, and we can figure this out together.”

Wishing you the very best on your new adventure in the best city in the world .
## My motivation
was to create a helpful resource for newcomers to London, drawing from my own experiences as a refugee from Ukraine.

The project aims to solve the challenges faced by newcomers by providing essential information on various aspects of life in London.

Through this project , I have  learned the value of sharing practical knowledge to assist others in navigating a new environment.

My project stands out for its complete  coverage, addressing key areas like health, banking, education, housing, and more, offering a useful guide for those starting a new chapter in London.

### I wanted to share a personal journey that led me to create a web resource dedicated to those, like myself, who embarked on a new chapter in London.

Having moved from the east of Ukraine, just 30 km from the war line, I found myself facing numerous challenges upon arriving in this vibrant yet unfamiliar city. Reflecting on my experiences, I was motivated to build a project that could serve as a guiding light for newcomers, something I wish I had when I first arrived.

This project is more than a website; it’s a heartfelt effort to solve the practical problems encountered by those who, like me, have taken the brave step of starting anew. From navigating the health system to understanding the complexity of banking, transportation, education, and more, the aim is to provide an accumulated guide based on real experiences.

Through this project , I’ve learned the immense power of shared knowledge in making a positive impact on the lives of others. It goes beyond just information; it’s about building a community that supports and uplifts those who are starting their journey in a new land.

What makes this project stand out is its heartfelt approach to addressing the varied challenges of relocation. It’s not just about facts and figures; it’s about the human experience and the emotions tied to building a new life.

I invite you to explore this resource, knowing that it was crafted with empathy, understanding, and the genuine desire to make the transition to London a bit smoother for those who, like us, have ventured into the unknown.

Wishing you all the best on your journey!
